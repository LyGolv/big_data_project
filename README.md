# Youtube Data Analysis

This project is an efficient and intuitive platform that compiles data. It consists of several modules such as `dashboard`, `spark`, and `youtube_api`. The `dashboard` module helps visualize the data in meaningful ways whereas the `spark` module aids in processing the data for efficient analysis. The `youtube_api` module is employed to fetch relevant data from YouTube.

In the project, these modules collaborate to form a robust data analysis platform. It helps users to interpret their YouTube data in a more comprehendible manner. 

Commit analysis shows constant and meticulous updates for optimal performance as well as regular bug fixes for smoother user experience. There is a positive emphasis on improving the user interface to make the platform accessible and simple to use.
